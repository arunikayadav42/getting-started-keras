# Getting Started with Keras

This repository is an example for my [medium article](https://medium.com/skyshidigital/getting-started-with-keras-624dbf106c87) with the same title. This repository cover simple text classification using keras with bag of word (BOW) to transform text into feature. If you need real world example of the implementation, you can also read my [other article](https://medium.com/skyshidigital/topic-and-intent-classifier-from-scratch-83278fb8cf3).

If you have further question you can contact me at himang27s@gmail.com
